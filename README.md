## UX

The philosophy followed in the design of this website is clarity and minimalist style to present the content efficiently. The choice of background pictures and colors is intended to immerse the fans in the muscial style of the band. 

Wireframes of the web pages were created to give a guidance to the visual and functional characterstics of the intended final design.
