                The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion
                albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson
                and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. The
                musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and
                British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don
                Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.

                The four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first few
                months of their five-year career as "the Monkees". This was due in part to the amount of time required
                to film the television series.[1] Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the
                beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They
                eventually fought for the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The
                television show was canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.

                A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and
                new records. The group has reunited and toured several times since then with different line-ups and
                varying degrees of success.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Davy Jones died on February 29, 2012, the surviving members reunited for a tour in
                November–December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. The Monkees continued to tour
                through their 2016 50th Anniversary, with Dolenz and Tork forming the core of the band and Nesmith
                continuing to join them occasionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dolenz described The Monkees as initially being "a TV show about an imaginary band… that wanted to be
                the Beatles that was never successful".[9] Ironically, the actor-musicians became one of the most
                successful bands of the 1960s. The Monkees have sold more than 75 million records worldwide
                making them one of the biggest selling groups of all time with international hits, including "Last
                Train to Clarksville", "Pleasant Valley Sunday", "Daydream Believer", and "I'm a Believer". Newspapers
                and magazines reported that the Monkees outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined in
                1967, but Nesmith claims in his autobiography Infinite Tuesday that it was a lie that he told
                an Australian reporter.
